            A tectonic plate is a large, rigid piece of the Earth's lithosphere that moves over the asthenosphere beneath it. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle, is broken into several large plates that shift and interact at their boundaries. 
            Tectonic plates are the primary drivers of seismic activity (earthquakes, volcanoes) and ocean formation. These plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere, and their movements are driven by mantle convection, gravity, and other forces.

        <rdfs:comment>
            A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. As the plates separate, magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap, creating new oceanic crust. 
            This process is primarily found in mid-ocean ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Divergent boundaries are typically characterized by volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the formation of new ocean floor. 
            Over time, these regions expand as more magma is injected, causing ocean basins to grow and continents to drift apart.

        <rdfs:comment>
            A convergent boundary is formed when two tectonic plates move towards each other. Depending on the types of plates involved (continental vs. oceanic, or oceanic vs. oceanic), different geological processes occur:
            - If an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate is subducted (forced beneath the continental plate), forming deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs.
            - If two continental plates converge, they can create mountain ranges through the process of continental collision, as seen in the formation of the Himalayas from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates.
            Convergent boundaries are often sites of intense seismic activity, including both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

        <rdfs:label>Transform Boundary</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:comment>
            A transform boundary occurs when two tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally. Unlike divergent or convergent boundaries, transform boundaries do not create or destroy crust, but the friction between the plates causes earthquakes. 
            One of the most well-known transform boundaries is the San Andreas Fault in California, where the Pacific Plate slides past the North American Plate. 
            These boundaries are often characterized by fault zones, where significant earthquake activity can occur over time.

        <rdfs:label>Crust</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:comment>
            The Earth's crust is the outermost layer, consisting of two types:
            - Continental crust, which is thick (about 30–50 km) and composed primarily of granitic rocks.
            - Oceanic crust, which is thinner (about 5–10 km) and composed mainly of basaltic rocks.
            The crust is rigid and brittle, and it is divided into tectonic plates that float on the more plastic and flowing mantle beneath. 
            The crust forms the continents and ocean floors, and tectonic plate movements at its boundaries lead to the geological activity on Earth's surface.

        <rdfs:label>Mantle</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:comment>
            The mantle lies beneath the Earth's crust and extends to a depth of approximately 2,900 km. It is composed mainly of silicate minerals rich in iron and magnesium, and its material behaves in a semi-solid, viscoelastic manner.
            The mantle is responsible for driving plate tectonics through mantle convection, where hotter, less dense material rises toward the surface, while cooler, denser material sinks toward the core. 
            The upper mantle, together with the crust, forms the lithosphere, which is rigid, while the asthenosphere beneath it is ductile and allows for the motion of tectonic plates.

        <rdfs:comment>
            The outer core is a layer of molten metal, primarily iron and nickel, located beneath the mantle and extending to about 5,150 km in depth. 
            The convection currents within the outer core generate Earth's magnetic field through the dynamo effect. 
            The outer core plays a critical role in Earth's internal heat transfer, contributing to mantle convection and the movement of tectonic plates.

        <rdfs:comment>
            The inner core is the Earth's deepest layer, extending from about 5,150 km to the center of the Earth. 
            Despite the extremely high temperatures, the inner core remains solid due to the immense pressure at this depth. The core is composed primarily of iron and nickel.
            The solid inner core plays a key role in the generation of Earth's magnetic field and contributes to the overall dynamics of mantle convection.

        <rdfs:comment>
            The Pacific Plate is the largest tectonic plate, covering much of the Pacific Ocean. 
            It is moving westward and is involved in both subduction zones, such as along the Mariana Trench, and transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault. 
            This plate is responsible for the creation of oceanic crust through divergent boundaries and the destruction of oceanic crust through subduction.

            The Eurasian Plate is a major tectonic plate that includes most of Europe, Asia, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. It is moving toward the Indian Plate, leading to the formation of the Himalayas through a convergent boundary. 
            The plate also interacts with the North American Plate at the mid-Atlantic ridge, where new oceanic crust is formed.

            The 'hasBoundaryType' property defines the relationship between a tectonic plate and the type of boundary it forms with other plates. 
            This is crucial for understanding how tectonic movements and geological features are shaped. 
            The boundaries can be divergent (plates move apart), convergent (plates move together), or transform (plates slide past one another).

            This relationship specifies that the Pacific Plate has a divergent boundary at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it moves away from the North American Plate, leading to the creation of new oceanic crust.
